# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
Data Bootcamp Final Project for NYU Spring 2019 Class

This project was completed by Carmina Magnani and Bethel Hailemichael in partial fulfillment of Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others- including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (with should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. 

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is stricly forbidden. 

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
