Data Bootcamp Final Project for NYU Spring 2019 Class

This project was completed by Carmina Magnani and Bethel Hailemichael in partial fulfillment of Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others- including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (with should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. 

And I understand that:

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description: Our project focuses on analyzing the different attributes of the wines reviewed by the Wine Enthusiast magazine. We focus on analyzing how the different countries of origin, pricing, grape varieties, and descriptions compare to the scores given to the wines. We also test our hypothesis about the length of a wine's description and its possible correlation to the type of scoring it receives.
